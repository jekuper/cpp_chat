1. Open a terminal.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the server application.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
msbuild cpp_chat_server.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

## Running the Sever
After building the solution, you can run the server with the specified command-line arguments. Here's an example:
